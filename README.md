# UIE Challenge

Pleo's UI engineer coding challenge.

What you see here is a simple ReactJS app composed of four sections.

The sections are lacking in the areas of semantics, usability, reusability and design aptitude.

One of the components in the solution is a dropdown selector. This component features two different themes. When a theme is selected it should trigger a visual change in the UI that relates to the name of the theme.

## We would like you to:

Abstract parts of the solution into individual components.<br />
Write an elegant solution to handle theming.<br />
Heigthen the overall quality of the components as you see fit.<br />
Update the visual aspects of the UI in a meaningful way.<br />
Add links to your favourite resources in the footer.<br />
Think scalability and flexilibity into the frontend architecture.

Everything including design, layout, code structure, naming, semantics, etc. can be challenged. \*Remember to document you changes, as we'll be very interested in hearing your motives.
